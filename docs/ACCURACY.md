In addition NanoBoyAdvance passes the following tests:
- AGS aging cartridge by Nintendo
  - NanoBoyAdvance was the first public emulator to pass all tests
  - Almost all emulators fail one or (most of the time) more tests
  - Recently a few upcoming but immature emulators started passing all tests as well

Passing these tests does not necessarily translate to compatibility or *overall* accuracy.
But they give a good indication of how truthful an emulator is to hardware in certain areas, such as timing and DMA.

# Game compatibility

This list intends to document games that used to or currently have issues in NanoBoyAdvance and rely on peculiar edge-cases.
Some of these issues are minor visual bugs, that do not affect gameplay, others are game breaking.

## Known working

- Hello Kitty Collection: Miracle Fashion Maker (mid-instruction DMA affects open bus: [mGBA blog article](https://mgba.io/2020/01/25/infinite-loop-holy-grail/))
- Classic NES series (various edge-cases: [mGBA blog article](https://mgba.io/2014/12/28/classic-nes/))
- James Pond - Codename Robocod (requires IRQ delaying: see [ARM7TDMI manual](https://documentation-service.arm.com/static/5e8e1323fd977155116a3129?token=) about IRQ/FIQ latencies)
- Phantasy Star Collection (DMA from write-only IO returns open bus: https://github.com/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance/issues/109)
- Pinball Tycoon ([internal affine registers are updated conditionally](https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/issues/1668#issuecomment-925306878))
- Gunstar Heroes (requires limiting sprite render cycles: https://github.com/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance/issues/98)
- Golden Sun (Sprite attributes are updated regardless of transparency: https://github.com/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance/issues/99) (minor issue)
- Iridion 3D (BGX/BGY writes are latched at the start of the scanline: https://github.com/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance/issues/176) (minor issue)
- Gadget Racers (requires sub-scanline precision: https://github.com/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance/issues/230)
- Metal Max Kai II (original revision) (requires sub-scanline precision: https://github.com/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance/issues/229) (minor issue)
- Madden NFL 06 (requires VRAM access stalling: https://github.com/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance/issues/241)
- All Inside-cap visual novel ports (emulator detection gets set off: https://github.com/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance/issues/203)

## Known broken

- Futari wa Precure - Ariennai! Yume no Sono wa Daimeikyuu: slight audio inaccuracies (see: https://github.com/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance/issues/325)

NanoBoyAdvance is a Game Boy Advance emulator with a focus on high accuracy.<br>

![screenshot1](docs/screenshot.png)

## Features
- highly-accurate GBA emulation
- HQ audio mixer (for titles which use the Sappy/MP2K/M4A sound engine)
- RTC emulation
- game controller support
- GLSL shader support

## Accuracy
- close to cycle-accurate CPU and DMA emulation
- hardware is updated at the bus cycle (sub-instruction) level
- very accurate ARM emulation
- PPU is still scanline based for now

See [ACCURACY.md](docs/ACCURACY.md) for more information on which tests NanoBoyAdvance passes and fails.

## Running

Get stable versions on the [releases page](https://github.com/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance/releases).
Or alternatively get the latest [nightly build ](https://nightly.link/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance/workflows/build/master).

A legitimate Game Boy Advance BIOS dump or a [replacement BIOS](https://github.com/Nebuleon/ReGBA/blob/master/bios/gba_bios.bin) is required.  
Do note though that the replacement BIOS is less accurate.

Place your BIOS file named as `bios.bin` into the same folder as the executable or provide a path via the CLI or [config.toml](https://github.com/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance/blob/master/src/platform/sdl/resource/config.toml)
#### CLI arguments
```
NanoboyAdvance.exe [--bios bios_path] [--force-rtc] [--save-type type] [--fullscreen] [--scale factor] [--resampler type] [--sync-to-audio yes/no] rom_path
```
See [config.toml](https://github.com/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance/blob/master/src/platform/sdl/resource/config.toml) for more documentation or options.

## Compiling

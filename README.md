# NanoboyAdvance

NanoboyAdvance is an experimental GameBoyAdvance (TM) emulator written in C++11. Its core is designed to be 100% platform-independent and to run games at good speed even on older hardware such as netbooks. Ports to mobile devices and handhelds are also planned, but might need more optimization or a JIT compiler though.

## Status:

The emulator is at an early stage but it can already boot a high amount of commercial games. Audio and many Graphics features are missing and timing is very inaccurate (doesn't distinguish between N/S cycles and no prefetch emulation).

## Compiling

For Windows users:

-IMPORTANT: You must download SDL2 at https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php  
-IMPORTANT: You must also download Qt at https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/ (if you want to build the Qt frontend)  
-You must add these to your MinGW folder by doing this: https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/bernstdh/Web/common/help/cpp_mingw-sdl-setup.php 

Linux users usually just install the libraries via package manager and should be good.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake %FLAGS% %SOURCE_PATH%
make
```
Replace `%FLAGS%` with flags (if any) with flags that shall be passed to `cmake`.  
Replace `%SOURCE_PATH%` with the path where you extracted the source / cloned the repository.  

### CMake Options
`DEBUG`: Enable compilation for debugging.  
`SDL2`: Enables SDL2 frontend (please note SDL2 is always required though, for audio)  
`QT_GUI`: Enables Qt5 frontend which is more user-friendly than the plain SDL2 build  
`PROFILE`: Compiles for profiling with GNU gprof.

- nocash/Martin Korth: for the creation of GBATEK
- VisualBoyAdvance Team: basically rocked my childhood and inspired me to write my own emulator.

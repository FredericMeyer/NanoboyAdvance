# NanoboyAdvance

NanoboyAdvance is a modern Game Boy Advance emulator written in C++ with performance, platform independency and reasonable accuracy in mind. This emulator is actively being developed on to reach the goals we're aiming for. However currently we still
have some work to do until a first release targeted at users. NanoboyAdvance will eventually target a great range of hardware and devices and will make use of efficient code and GPU-based hardware acceleration for the best emulation experience on low power devices while maintaining a clean and understandable code base.
